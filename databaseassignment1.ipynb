    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that facilitates efficient retrieval, \n",
    "management, and manipulation of data. Databases are used in various applications to store and manage structured or unstructured data,\n",
    "ranging from simple lists and tables to complex relationships and multimedia content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiating SQL and NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "SQL Databases (Relational Databases):\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: SQL databases are structured databases that organize data into tables with rows and columns. The schema is predefined, and\n",
    "data is stored in a tabular format.\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases typically have a fixed schema, meaning the structure of the data (columns, data types, relationships) must be\n",
    "defined before data insertion.\n",
    "Query Language: SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to interact with SQL databases. SQL provides a \n",
    "standardized syntax for querying, updating, and managing data.\n",
    "ACID Transactions: SQL databases generally support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, \n",
    "                   ensuring data integrity and consistency.\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.\n",
    "NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational Databases):\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that store data in a flexible, schema-less format.\n",
    "                   They can handle unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "Schema: NoSQL databases often have dynamic schemas, allowing for easy modification and adaptation to changing data requirements.\n",
    "Query Language: NoSQL databases may use different query languages or APIs depending on the specific database type and implementation.\n",
    "                   Some databases support SQL-like querying, while others use proprietary query languages or APIs.\n",
    "ACID Transactions: NoSQL databases may offer eventual consistency rather than strong consistency, sacrificing some guarantees\n",
    "                   of ACID transactions for scalability and performance.\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Redis.\n",
    "Key Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use a structured schema with tables and SQL for querying, while NoSQL databases are non-relational\n",
    "                   and offer more flexible data models without a fixed schema.\n",
    "SQL databases are well-suited for applications with complex relationships and structured data, while NoSQL databases excel in handling\n",
    "unstructured or semi-structured data, high-volume data, and applications requiring horizontal scalability.\n",
    "SQL databases generally offer strong consistency and ACID transactions, while NoSQL databases may prioritize scalability, availability,\n",
    "and partition tolerance (CAP theorem) over strong consistency."
